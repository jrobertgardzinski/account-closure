/**
 * Every message the account-closure saga sends, by the name it goes by on the wire — and, in the
 * order below, the whole conversation.
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Identity states {@link #ACCOUNT_DELETION_REQUESTED}: an account is closing, here is who
 *       asked and under which conditions.</li>
 *   <li>The orchestrator commands each participant to {@link #PURGE_USER_CONTENT} — mark and hide,
 *       reversibly, because nothing may be destroyed while the saga can still fail.</li>
 *   <li>Each participant answers {@link #USER_CONTENT_PURGED} once its content is out of sight.</li>
 *   <li>With every participant in, the orchestrator commands {@link #ERASE_USER_CONTENT} and tells
 *       identity {@link #PORTAL_CONTENT_PURGED}; having given up, it commands
 *       {@link #RESTORE_USER_CONTENT} and says {@link #PORTAL_PURGE_FAILED} instead.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>These are constants rather than an enum on purpose: they cross five services and three
 * frameworks, they are read out of JSON, and a consumer that meets a name from a newer producer
 * must be able to ignore it rather than fail to deserialise a value object. What this type buys is
 * that nobody spells one of them twice.

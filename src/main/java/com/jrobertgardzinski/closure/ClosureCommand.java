 * that is the point. Three participants were each about to declare their own record of exactly
 * these five fields, which is the shape of drift this library exists to prevent: the day the
 * agreement gains a field, one of the three would have been the one that forgot it.

 * <p>{@code rule} is the condition stated for THE READER'S OWN axis — the reader pulls it out of
 * {@link ClosureMessages.Field#POLICY} under its own name, because only it knows what that name
 * is, and only it knows what the words mean. Empty means the command stated nothing, which is not
 * the same as stating "destroy": absent leaves the deployment its say, and a self-closure does
 * not (see {@link ClosureInitiator}).
 *
 * @param type        the command's name on the wire
 * @param sagaId      the orchestrator's handle on this closure; the only one of these safe to log
 * @param email       whose account is closing — PII, and never written to a log
 * @param initiatedBy {@link ClosureInitiator} as a word; decides whether conditions count at all
 * @param rule        the condition stated for the reader's own axis, if the command carried one
